game to collect points against computer

The player will have to guess the correct items to get to the computers answer. The items displayed on the screen are a hidden point value the player will guess with numbers instead of letters. 
Here's how the app works:

There will be four food options displayed as buttons on the page.
The player will be shown a random number at the start of the game.

When the player clicks on a food item, it will add a specific amount of points to the player's total score. 

The player wins if their total score matches the random number from the beginning of the game.
The player loses if their score goes above the random number.

The game restarts whenever the player wins or loses.


When the game begins again, the player should see a new random number.
